# KNOWN_DIFFERENCES

- Full route/controller/page parity with the original runtime source is not yet complete because only database backup and static assets were available in this workspace.
- Some reconstructed modules are schema-driven approximations where original business-rule edge cases (from unavailable legacy source) could differ.
- Settings subsections (appearance/security/activity-log/database-backup/preferences) are currently grouped into a unified settings page instead of separate dedicated routes/pages.
